  summary: Python implementations of metric learning algorithms

  description: metric-learn contains efficient Python implementations of several popular supervised and weakly-supervised metric learning algorithms. As part of scikit-learn-contrib, the API of metric-learn is compatible with scikit-learn, the leading library for machine learning in Python. This allows to use all the scikit-learn
    routines (for pipelining, model selection, etc) with metric learning algorithms through a unified interface.
